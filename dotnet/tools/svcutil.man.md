##### CODE GENERATION

** Description **

svcutil.exe can generate code for service contracts, clients and data types from metadata documents. These metadata documents can be on disk or retrieved online. Online retrieval follows either the WS-Metadata Exchange protocol or the DISCO protocol.

###### Syntax:
`svcutil.exe [/t:code]  <metadataDocumentPath>* | <url>* | <epr>`

|Parameter | Description |
|:---:|:---|
|`<metadataDocumentPath>`| The path to a metadata document (wsdl or xsd). Standard command-line wildcards can be used in the file path.|
 |`<url>`|                  The URL to a service endpoint that provides metadata or to a metadata document hosted online. For more information on how these documents are retrieved see the Metadata Download section.|
 |`<epr>`|                   The path to an XML file that contains a WS-Addressing EndpointReference for a service endpoint that supports WS-Metadata Exchange. For more information see the Metadata Download section.|

##### METADATA EXPORT

###### Description

 svcutil.exe can export metadata for services, contracts and data types in compiled assemblies. To export metadata for a service, you must use the /serviceName option to indicate the service you would like to export. To export all Data Contract types within an assembly use the /dataContractOnly option. By default metadata is exported for all Service Contracts in the input assemblies.

**Syntax:**

`svcutil.exe [/t:metadata] [/serviceName:<serviceConfigName>] [/dataContractOnly] <assemblyPath>*`

 <assemblyPath> - The path to an assembly that contains services, contracts or Data Contract types to be exported. Standard command-line wildcards can be used to provide multiple files as input.

Options:

 /serviceName:<serviceConfigName> - The config name of a service to export. If this option is used, an executable assembly with an associated config file must be passed as input. Svcutil will search through all associated config files for the service configuration. If the config files contain any extension types, the assemblies containing these types must either be in the GAC or explicitly provided using the /r option.
 /reference:<file path>           - Add the specified assembly to the set of assemblies used for resolving type references. If you are exporting or validating a service that uses 3rd-party extensions (Behaviors, Bindings and BindingElements) registered in config use this option to locate extension assemblies that are not in the GAC.  (Short Form: /r)
 /dataContractOnly                - Operate on Data Contract types only. Service Contracts will not be processed. (Short Form: /dconly)
 /excludeType:<type>              - The fully-qualified or assembly-qualified name of a type to exclude from export. This option can be used when exporting metadata for a service or a set of service contracts to exclude types from being exported. This option cannot be used with the /dconly option. (Short Form: /et)



             -= SERVICE VALIDATION =-

Description: Validation is useful to detect errors in service implementations without hosting the service. You must use the /serviceName option to indicate the service you would like to validate.

Syntax: svcutil.exe /validate /serviceName:<serviceConfigName>  <assemblyPath>*

 <assemblyPath> - The path to an assembly containing service types to be validated. The assembly must have an associated config file to provide service configuration. Standard command-line wildcards can be used to provide multiple assemblies.

Options:

 /validate                        - Validate a service implementation. To validate a service, you must use the /serviceName option to indicate the service you would like to validate. If this option is used, an executable assembly with an associated config file must be passed as input. (Short Form: /v)
 /serviceName:<serviceConfigName> - The config name of a service to validate. To validate a service this option must be provided. Svcutil will search through the associated config files of all input assemblies for the service configuration. If the associated configuration file contain any extension types, the assemblies containing these types must either be in the GAC or explicitly provided using the /r option.
 /reference:<file path>           - Add the specified assembly to the set of assemblies used for resolving type references. If you are exporting or validating a service that uses 3rd-party extensions (Behaviors, Bindings and BindingElements) registered in config use this option to locate extension assemblies that are not in the GAC.  (Short Form: /r)
 /dataContractOnly                - Operate on Data Contract types only. Service Contracts will not be processed. (Short Form: /dconly)
 /excludeType:<type>              - The fully-qualified or assembly-qualified name of a service type to exclude from validation. (Short Form: /et)



              -= METADATA DOWNLOAD =-

Description: svcutil.exe can be used to download metadata from running services and save the metadata to local files. To download metadata, you must explicitly specify the /t:metadata option. Otherwise, client code will be generated. For http and https URL schemes svcutil.exe will try to retrieve metadata using WS-Metadata Exchange and DISCO. For all other URL schemes svcutil.exe will only try WS-Metadata Exchange. By default, svcutil.exe uses the bindings defined in the System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataExchangeBindings class. To configure the binding used for WS-Metadata Exchange you must define a client endpoint in config that uses the IMetadataExchange contract. This can be defined either in svcutil.exe's config file or in another config file specified using the /svcutilConfig option.

Syntax: svcutil.exe /t:metadata  <url>* | <epr>

 <url> - The URL to a service endpoint that provides metadata or an URL that points to a metadata document hosted online.
 <epr> - The path to an XML file that contains a WS-Addressing EndpointReference for a service endpoint that supports WS-Metadata Exchange.



        -= XMLSERIALIZER TYPE GENERATION =-

Description: svcutil.exe can pre-generate C# serialization code that is required for types that can be serialized using the XmlSerializer. svcutil.exe will only generate code for types used by Service Contracts found in the input assemblies.

Syntax: svcutil.exe /t:xmlSerializer  <assemblyPath>*

 <assemblyPath> - The path to an assembly containing Service Contract types. Serialization types will be generated for all Xml Serializable types in each contract

Options:

 /reference:<file path> - Add the specified assembly to the set of assemblies used for resolving type references. (Short Form: /r)
 /excludeType:<type>    - Fully-qualified or assembly-qualified type name to exclude from export or validation. This option can be used when exporting metadata for a service or a set of service contracts to exclude types from being exported. This option cannot be used with the /dataContractOnly option. (Short Form: /et)
 /out:<file>            - Filename for the generated code. This option will be ignored when multiple assemblies are passed as input to the tool. Default: derived from the assembly name. (Short Form: /o)
